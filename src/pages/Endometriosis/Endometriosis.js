          Diagnosis Delay
            </h3>
          <p className={styles.cardText}>
          On average, it can take up to 6 to 10 years for a woman to receive an accurate diagnosis of endometriosis. This is due to a combination of factors including normalization of symptoms and variability in disease presentation.
